## 1. Project Overview
This repository accompanies my Bachelor’s Thesis in Mathematics. Although the thesis document itself is **not included** (due to university restrictions), this repository provides background information, references, and supplementary materials related to the project.


## 2. Abstract

The objective of this Bachelor’s Thesis is to study the structure of complete
Noetherian local rings which contain a field. To this end, we will introduce several
fundamental concepts in the field of commutative algebra, such as the tensor
product, the inverse limit and completion. The latter construction allows certain
algebraic structures, previously endowed a topology, to be extended by adding the
limits of Cauchy sequences. In particular, it will be shown that these rings are finitely
generated as modules over a formal power series ring. We will additionally study conditions
under which they are isomorphic to a quotient of that ring, or even to the ring
itself. These results make it possible to describe, using well-understood structures,
rings which otherwise are very difficult to handle directly, thereby facilitating their
study.

## 3. Mathematical Concepts

- **Commutative algebra.**
- **Tensor product.**
- **Direct and inverse limits.**
- **Topologies and completions in groups and rings.**
- **Local rings and coefficient fields.**
- **Structure theorems of complete Noetherian local rings.**

## 4. Methods and Approach

- Studying core algebraic constructions, such as tensor products, inverse limits, and completions.
- Conducting a literature review on commutative Noetherian local rings.
- Synthesizing findings from multiple sources into a cohesive 40-page LaTeX manuscript.
